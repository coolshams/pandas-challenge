**Player Count:

Total number of players= count of unique values in 'column' SN

**Purchasing Analysis(Total):

Number of unique items= count of unique values in 'column' Item Name
Average purchase price = sum of values in 'column'price/count of values in 'column' price
Total number of purchases= count of values in 'column' price or 'column' purchase ID
Total revenue (for each item) = price * quantity = sum of each Item Name bought * Price of each item
eg: Quickblade Of Trembling Hands has been bought 9 times & price per is $3.53
So total revenue for Quickblade of Trembling Hands = 9*3.53 = $31.77
Overall Total revenue = sum of total revenue for each item-Nope they meant total price
